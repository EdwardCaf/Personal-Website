## Milky Way 2023

For reference, the Milky Way's core is only visible for people in my area from March - September. Out of those months, you need nights without clouds during the handful of hours it's above the horizon and no moonlight. This comes out to about ~30 or so days spread out across those summer months that are ideal conditions.

If you know me then you know I have been obsessed with photographing of the Milky Way. All last year I went at every opportunity I had to experiment with my shots. Most of the year I spent fighting camera settings and getting a feel for differently light polluted areas. I also have some new gear to bring out including my new D850 and a Tamron f1.4 lens. 

This year I plan to try:

- New locations
- Foreground subjects 
- Editing techniques
- Making prints of my photos
- Overall improvement of quality

I would love to attempt a night in Maine for truly dark skies. It's something I haven't had a good chance of photographing since my trip to Utah, but I have been wanting to attempt again ever since. I'm excited to see what kinds of pictures I am able to take this year.

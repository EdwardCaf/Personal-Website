## 7/30/2022

As I write this, my wife is almost exactly 2 weeks away from her due date and we couldn't be more excited and nervous at the same time. This is our first baby and also both of our parents' first grandchild. Needless to say he'll be spoiled by all of us.

For as long as I can remember I've wanted to be a dad but never quite imagined the day would actually arrive. I feel incredibly blessed to be starting a family and for all of us to be in good health going into it.

### Re-discovering what's important

My mind has been consistenly thinking over "What type of father do I want to be for my child?" and "What is my role in parenthood/life?". More specifically these last 2 months I've noticed a lot of differences in the way I see the world and my place in it.

I was raised Catholic, taught to be frugal with money (save as much as I could afford to) and to be an upstanding person to others in my life. Looking back at my 20's I fell short in all regards and have only now begun prioritizing those very principles. The simple act of having a child marks my life as something only temporary by bringing someone into this world who will outlive me.

It's forced me to come to terms with what I want my own legacy to be and that of my family. To lower my time preference and seek out experiences that will last rather than short term pleasures and material things. To create rather than to consume.

### About my Son

He will be named Edward William Cafarella. Edward, after me, my father, grandfather, and his grandfather. In fact, the name of my ancestor that came to America in the mid to late 1800s was named Edward French. It goes wihtout saying the name has a special place in my family and I would like to continue its' legacy as long as possible. His middle name will be after Bria's grandfather, making our son's name something unique while still a homage to our older relatives.

We are looking forward to meeting you Edward!

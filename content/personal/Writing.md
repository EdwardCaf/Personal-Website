I am sitting here thinking about what I want to write. Most nights I write about what is going on in my life. It crossed my mind to write about this exact thing. I find writing out my thoughts at night at the end of most days is a great a way to clear my head and get out some the ideas lurking inside. 

I know, it sounds cliche, but I seriously everyone should do it to some extent. Maybe once a week just write a short paragraph or two and see where it takes you. You don’t have to write a book or lengthy essay. If it ends after a couple sentences then that’s okay too. Just give it a shot.

Every so often I find myself wanting to write a poem and that ends up being a good creative outlet for me. It often surprises me what I uncover while writing. All ranges of emotions and thoughts come out in my writing. 

Obviously I choose what to share with the world. If my website is a portion of my total writing, then it makes up less than 1-5% of my entire collection. I attribute this to a feeling of vulnerability I’m subject to when sharing my thoughts. Just a personal choice, I want to attempt to share more of my thoughts with the world and I think I will make that a personal goal in the future.

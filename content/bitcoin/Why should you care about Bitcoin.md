## Questions to ask yourself.

By this point, you've no doubt heard about **Bitcoin** and have made some kind of a judgement about what it is and whether or not it means anything to you. I want to present you with some new ideas and ways to look at Bitcoin that might change your perspective on it.

I encourage you to think about the following questions and also look up videos/articles to come to your own understanding of them:

- What actually IS **money**?
- What's the impact of **inflation** on my savings over a long time period?
- Am I restricted in using my own money in any way by the current financial system?

## Why I rooted my 3DS

By flashing the firmware on my 3DS, I have opened the hardwarre up to being able to run all different kinds of software. Some of which include emulators which were the particular purpose of this project. I intend to use my 3DS now to play games from GBC, GBA, DS, N64, and others all in one platform.

#### **_DISCLAIMER:_** _This process can brick your device and render it unusable so it is strongly advised you understand what you are getting yourself into before starting._

That being said, I would rate this process as pretty straight-forward and easy for people who have at least basic computer skills. Even if you aren't tech savvy, most of this guide consists of copying, pasting, and following **VERY** concise instructions in the guide linked below. It should be doable for most people.

## How to Homebrew

### What you need

1. Preferably a "new" 3DS or 2DS as the original models have weaker processors and are a bit more sluggish in emulation.
2. A microSD card >=8GB in size for backing up BIOS and storing games.
3. A way to connect the microSD card to your PC and copy files back and forth.

### Steps to Follow

1. Follow [this guide](https://3ds.hacks.guide).
2. Pay close notice to what version your 3DS is currently running to determine what section to follow.
3. **Follow the guide CLOSELY and don't skip any steps.**
4. Add whatever custom software you want and enjoy!

If anyone has questions I am open to answering them and helping you along with the process!

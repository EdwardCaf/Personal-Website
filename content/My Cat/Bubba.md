# Bubba

This is a blog post about my bubba.

He is a great cat but sometimes he like to bite us. I love him despite all the times he is mean to me <3. He loves when I come home because that means he's getting fed.

One time he scratched Bria and made her bleed. We had to spray him with the water bottle.
